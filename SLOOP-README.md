SLOOP turns the FM-1 into a four-track groovebox you play live: **three synths and a drum machine** with 16 sounds on the white keys, nine synthesis engines, 68 sounds, 37 drum kits, your own samples, a song mode you play with your hands — and now **USB audio**, a **MIDI keyboard on the jack**, **MIDI clock**, **lights for playing in the dark** and a **full backup**. House, techno, hip-hop, trap, drum & bass, amapiano, synthwave, lo-fi, ambient, chiptune — it does not pick a style for you. No factory patterns, nothing to load: everything you hear, you play.

> **Status:** 2.3. Still a beta: install at your own risk, and please [report](../../issues) what you find. Your projects, presets, samples and settings are kept when you update, and you can go back at any time (see [Going back](#going-back)).

## What's new in 2.3

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **USB audio** | On USB the FM-1 is also an audio input (*Felucca*, 44.1 kHz stereo, no driver): record it in your DAW or Audacity over the same cable. Its level follows the MASTER knob, or stays at a fixed full level (HOME menu → **USB AUDIO**). From Felucca 1.0. |
| **MIDI keyboard on the jack** | The 3.5 mm TRS MIDI IN works: a keyboard or a pad controller through a TRS-to-DIN adapter. Channels 1–3 the synths, 10 the drums, 4–16 the selected track. No note left hanging. |
| **MIDI clock in** | GLO → SYSTEM → **SYNC** = USB or TRS: SLOOP follows a DAW or a drum machine — tempo, START, CONTINUE, STOP — pulse by pulse, with no drift. |
| **Record your way** | The REC screen has three dials: **mode** (*free*: the tempo follows your playing, or *tempo*: the tempo you set), **length** (1, 2 or 4 bars), **start** (your first note, or a one-bar **count-in** after PLAY). |
| **Lights for playing in the dark** | HOME menu: **LIGHTS** (every button glows, LOW / MID / HIGH), **KEYS** (the C keys or every white key), **NOTES** (the notes playing light their keys, by @renebohne). |
| **Backup and restore** | The web editor saves everything on the FM-1 in one file — the music in progress, projects, user presets, samples, settings — and puts it all back. |
| **CHOP, any length** | A recording longer than a sample slot (about 7 s) works: keep the chops you want, shorten them, or **Fit to slot**. |
| **Back to the official firmware** | From the installer page, with a backup first: select M-VAVE's FM-1 V15 file and install it. |
| **Steadier** | Knobs that answer every click; no dropped notes over USB MIDI; one voice fades on overload, never the bass or the lead; keys a millisecond faster; no stuck note after a VOICE change; stricter checks of what is read back from flash. |

The full list, and what came in 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2: [SLOOP.md](SLOOP.md#new-in-23). Release notes: [Releases](../../releases).

## Features

### Play it live: hold a button, touch a key

Every function button is a **layer**: hold it and the 16 white keys and the four knobs change job, and the screen shows how. Tap it and its pages open. Hold a layer button and tap HOME to **lock** it open, both hands free.

| Hold | The white keys | KNOB 1 · 2 · 3 · 4 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **FX** — punch | 16 punch-in effects on the whole mix: loops 1/4–1/32, stutter, reverse, tape stop, half speed, filter sweeps, phone, bit crush, alias, gate, echo, tape wobble | FILTER · DUST · DUCK |
| **EDIT** — erase | erase a sound or a note as the loop plays (stopped: from the whole pattern) | SHIFT · LENGTH ×2 / ½ · TRANSPOSE |
| **ARP** — roll | note repeat on the grid, recorded as ratchets | RATE (1/8 … 1/64) |
| **SEQ** — steps | the 16 steps of the page, with a level and a ratchet per step | SOUND / NOTE · DIV · SWING · LENGTH |
| **SCL** — key | the key of the song | CHORD · SCALE · KEYS · TRANSPOSE |
| **GLO** — mix | 1–4 mute, 5–8 solo, 16 tap tempo | the levels of tracks 1–4 |
| **SAVE** — song | 1–4 play sections A–D, 5–8 save the loop into them, 13 loop / song, 14 record the song, 16 the chain | — |

Keys 1, 5, 9 and 13 glow dimly while a layer is held: the first key of each row of the 4 × 4 grid on the screen. **EDIT + OCT− / OCT+** is undo / redo.

### Drums

- **16 sounds on the white keys**, kick to cowbell; a black key doubles the white key on its left (fast rolls with two fingers).
- **Ghost and hard hits:** hold OCT− / OCT+ while you play. Every hit keeps its level (GHOST, SOFT, NORM, HARD) and a **ratchet** (x1–x4).
- **37 kits**, all level-matched: a sampled acoustic kit in 5 treatments (CC0 studio recordings) and 32 synthesised kits — 808, 909, 606, 80s, vintage, trap, drill, boom bap, lo-fi, phonk, house, deep house, techno, minimal, electro, disco, UK garage, jungle, dubstep, reggaeton, amapiano, afrobeat, latin, tribal, synthwave, chiptune, arcade, glitch, industrial, hyperpop, ambient, jazz brushes. Each synthesised sound is built like on the classic machines; softer hits are darker as well as quieter.
- **Grid and kit pages** on the FM-1 (EDIT or SEQ on the drum track), and a 16-lane grid in the web editor.

### Synths and sounds

- **Nine engines:** analog, 4-op FM, phase distortion, three-oscillator, tonewheel organ, formant voice, granular, lo-fi chip, sampler.
- **68 sounds, browsed by kind** — basses (sliding 808s, acid 303, reese, FM), keys (Rhodes, a real Steinway grand, house and afro keys), organs, pads, leads (supersaw, talkbox), plucks and bells, stabs and dub chords — every one level-matched. **32 slots** for your own presets.
- Envelopes (with a pitch punch for 808s), LFO, arpeggiator, glide and voice modes (POLY, MONO, LEGATO, UNISON), per-track drive and slicer, sends to a **stereo chorus**, a **tempo delay** and a **stereo reverb**.
- **Key and chords (SCL):** the key of the song for all synths, 16 scales, one-key chords (triad, 7th, 9th, sus4, power), keys snapped to the scale or the scale on the white keys.

### Recording and the sequencer

- **Records as you play, no click needed:** while it plays, REC records at once and every pass is added on top (overdub). Notes land where you heard them: the ~12 ms of the keys are taken back.
- **The REC screen (2.3):** **mode** *free* — no tempo, no grid: play, press REC on the "1" after your last bar, and the loop's length sets the tempo — or *tempo* — record at the tempo you set; **length** 1, 2 or 4 bars; **start** on your first note, or after a one-bar **count-in**.
- **Hold REC ~2 s** to clear a track; **undo / redo** brings it back.
- **64 steps per track**, each track with its own length and division (polymeters stay in phase); chords up to 4 notes a step, ties, slide; **MPC swing** 50–75 %; one sample-accurate clock for everything: no drift at any tempo.
- The PLAY light flashes on every beat (a visual metronome); an audible click is in GLO → GLOBAL → CLICK and is never recorded.

### Songs

Save up to four sections **A–D** (SAVE + keys 5–8), play them live on the next bar (SAVE + keys 1–4), and **record the song as you play it** (SAVE + key 14). In song mode PLAY plays the whole chain. The SONG screen edits it by hand.

### Effects and master

- **16 punch-in effects** (FX + a key), locked to the tempo.
- **Master:** **DUST** (an old sampler and a record: bits, rate, crackle), **DUCK** (the kick pumps the synths), **FILT** (a DJ filter: low-pass ← off → high-pass), and an output limiter.

### Your own samples

- **Three slots** (USR1–USR3) of about 7.4 s each, played by a synth track; up to 16 WAV files per slot, each on its own key.
- **CHOP** in the web editor: open or drop a recording (WAV, MP3, AIFF…) of **any length**, tap along while it plays (each tap snaps to its hit), or find the hits, a tempo grid, equal parts; keep the chops you want, shorten them or **Fit to slot**; send them to a slot, one per key, or download them as WAV files.

### MIDI

- **USB MIDI** in and out, class compliant.
- **TRS MIDI IN** (the 3.5 mm jack, 2.3) for a keyboard or a pad controller.
- **MIDI clock in** (USB or TRS): tempo, START, CONTINUE, STOP.
- Details: [MIDI and USB audio](#midi-and-usb-audio).

### USB audio (2.3)

The FM-1 is also a **USB audio input**: record its master output on a computer, no driver, over the same cable as MIDI and the editor. Details: [USB audio](#usb-audio-record-the-fm-1-on-a-computer).

### Lights for playing in the dark (2.3)

Every button can glow so its label is readable on a black FM-1; the C keys or every white key can glow too; the notes playing can light their keys. Details: [The menu](#the-menu-settings-of-the-fm-1).

### Memory and safety

- **Autosave:** stop and leave it 2.5 s, your work is kept; at power-on SLOOP comes back exactly as you left it.
- **4 projects**, **32 user presets**, **undo / redo**.
- **Full backup and restore** from the web editor (2.3).
- **Safe updates:** the installer checks the package (SHA-256) before writing it, the update loader checks it again (CRC) before starting it; an interrupted install finishes when you press Install again; **USB rescue** (OCT− at power-on).

## Install

### From the browser (recommended)

1. Open **[the SLOOP installer](https://isod89.github.io/sloop-fm1/)** in **Chrome or Edge** on a computer.
2. Connect the FM-1 by USB — a **data** cable, directly (no hub).
3. Press **INSTALL**, allow MIDI access, and wait for *Done*. The FM-1 restarts on the SLOOP logo.

Nothing to download or compile. Your projects, user presets, samples and settings are kept. After an install, **unplug and plug the FM-1 back in** once so the computer finds its USB audio input.

### Other ways

- **Python:** the `.fwsc` of a [release](../../releases) with `python tools/fm1_install.py sloop-2.3.fwsc` (needs `pip install mido python-rtmidi`).
- **Build it yourself:** see [Building and tests](#building-and-tests); on Windows, `INSTALL-SLOOP.bat` builds SLOOP and opens the installer locally.

### Going back

- **To an earlier SLOOP:** install the `.fwsc` of its [release](../../releases) (for example [2.2](../../releases/tag/v2.2)). It keeps your work and simply ignores the 2.3 settings.
- **To the official firmware:** on the installer page, open **Return to the official firmware (V15)**. Save a backup with the editor first, download FM-1 V15 from m-vave.com and select its `FM-1.fwsc` — only that exact file is accepted. M-VAVE's updater, M-UPGRADE, works too. To come back, install SLOOP again and restore your backup.

### Rescue

- **The FM-1 no longer starts SLOOP:** hold **OCT−** alone while switching it on (*SLOOP USB RESCUE*), then install again.
- **An install was cut off:** the FM-1 stays in update mode; press INSTALL again and it finishes.
- If an FM-1 no longer starts at all, recovery needs [FM-1-transporter](https://github.com/kurogedelic/FM-1-transporter).

> Custom firmware is installed at your own risk. No warranty.

## Your first beat in 60 seconds

1. **ALGORITHM** to track **4** (orange, drums). The white keys are 16 drum sounds; **PRESETS** picks a kit (try *808* or *BOOMBAP*).
2. Press **REC** and play a beat freely, at your own tempo. Hold **OCT−** while you hit for ghost notes, **OCT+** for hard ones.
3. **Press REC on the "1" after your last bar.** The loop closes, its length sets the tempo, the hits snap to the grid and it plays at once. (Prefer a set tempo, or a count-in? Turn KNOB 1 and KNOB 3 on the REC screen before you start.)
4. **REC** again while it plays: you record on top. Hold **ARP** and hold the hat key for a hat roll.
5. **ALGORITHM** to track **1**, **REC**, play a bass line. Hold **SCL** and press the key of your song; on track 2, hold SCL and turn **KNOB 1** to *7TH*: every white key now plays a chord.
6. Hold **FX** and press a white key for a punch-in effect; still holding FX, turn **KNOB 2** for DUST, **KNOB 3** for DUCK.
7. A mistake? Hold **EDIT** and press **OCT−**: undo.

## The controls

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **MASTER** | volume (and the USB audio level, if USB AUDIO is on MASTER) |
| **SELECT** | tempo, on every page, even inside a layer |
| **ALGORITHM** | the selected track: 1 · 2 · 3 (synths) · 4 (drums) |
| **PRESETS** | the selected track's sound, or the drum kit |
| **KNOB 1–4** | what the four dials at the bottom of the screen show, each in its colour |
| **OCT− / OCT+** | octave (both: back to 0) · on the drum track, held: ghost / hard hits |
| **FX · SCL · ENV · LFO · EDIT · GLO** (top row) | tap: their pages · hold FX, SCL, EDIT, GLO: a layer. **SCL** is the second button of the top row, between FX and ENV |
| **HOME** | the TRACKS screen · hold: the menu · tapped while a layer is held: lock it |
| **SAVE** | on TRACKS: the SONG screen · elsewhere: the SAVE pages · hold: the song layer |
| **ARP · SEQ** | tap: their pages · hold: note repeat · steps |
| **PLAY** | start / stop all four tracks; its light flashes on every beat |
| **REC** | playing: record now / stop · stopped: arm (the REC screen) · hold: clear the track |
| **EDIT + OCT− / OCT+** | undo / redo |

Colours: **blue** track 1 and KNOB 1, **green** 2, **yellow** 3, **orange** 4 (drums). White is what you touch; red is recording.

## The menu: settings of the FM-1

Hold **HOME**. **PRESETS** moves, **KNOB 1** sets, **OCT+** steps round, **OCT−** closes. These are settings of the FM-1, not of a project: loading a project or NEW PROJECT does not change them, and the backup keeps them.

| Item | Choices | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **COLOR** | 5 palettes | the screen's colours |
| **LOWCUT** | OFF / ON | a low cut for the small built-in speaker |
| **ZOOM** | OFF / ON | a large readout of the value you turn |
| **LIGHTS** | OFF / LOW / MID / HIGH | every button glows at that level; what is active stays at full light |
| **KEYS** | OFF / C KEYS / WHITE KEYS | the C keys, or every white key, glow too |
| **NOTES** | OFF / ON | the notes playing on a synth track light their keys, on every page and in every layer |
| **USB AUDIO** | MASTER / FULL | the level of the USB audio input: follows the MASTER knob, or a fixed full level |
| **HARDWARE CALIBRATION** | | the panel table, if a key or a knob answers wrongly |
| **ABOUT** | | the version (*SLOOP 2.3*) and its build date, the credits |

Two more settings of the FM-1 live elsewhere: **SYNC** (GLO → SYSTEM: INT, USB or TRS) and the REC screen's **mode** and **start**.

## MIDI and USB audio

### MIDI in

SLOOP takes MIDI from two places at once:

- **The MIDI IN jack** (3.5 mm TRS): a keyboard or a pad controller with a MIDI output, through a **TRS-to-DIN MIDI adapter**. If nothing plays, try the other adapter type (A / B).
- **USB**, from a computer or a phone (a DAW, a MIDI routing app) or a USB MIDI host box.

| MIDI channel | Plays |
| --- | --- |
| 1, 2, 3 | synth tracks 1, 2, 3 |
| 10 | the drum track (the nearest of its 16 sounds; GLO → DRUMS → CH changes the channel) |
| 4–16 | the selected track: set your keyboard to channel 4 and it follows ALGORITHM |

A USB keyboard plugged **straight into the FM-1** cannot work: both are USB devices, and a USB link needs a host (a computer, a phone, or a USB MIDI host box). Bluetooth MIDI is not supported: SLOOP, like Felucca, never switches the radio on.

### MIDI clock in

GLO → SYSTEM → **SYNC** = **USB** or **TRS** (INT: SLOOP's own tempo). START plays from the top, CONTINUE carries on, STOP stops; the tempo follows the master and the steps follow its 24 pulses a beat, so SLOOP never drifts. When the clock stops for half a second, PLAY on the FM-1 plays at its own tempo again.

### USB audio: record the FM-1 on a computer

On USB the FM-1 is also an **audio input named "Felucca"**: 44.1 kHz, 16-bit stereo, class compliant — no driver on Windows, macOS or Linux. Choose it in your DAW or in Audacity and record: you get the master output, exactly what the headphones play (after DUST, DUCK and FILT). MIDI, the web editor and the installer keep working on the same cable.

- **The level:** HOME menu → **USB AUDIO**. **MASTER** (default): the recording follows the MASTER knob, as the headphones do — keep MASTER well up while you record. **FULL**: a fixed level, as with MASTER all the way up, kept from clipping by the limiter; MASTER then only sets the headphones (the right choice for an interface with no level control).
- **The first time** (and after an install), the computer sets the FM-1 up again as a MIDI + audio device: unplug and plug it back in if the input does not show. The MIDI port keeps its name.
- The audio input comes from Felucca 1.0.

## The web editor

Open it from the [installer page](https://isod89.github.io/sloop-fm1/) (or the [editor link](https://isod89.github.io/sloop-fm1/webapp/editor/)) in Chrome or Edge, with the FM-1 on USB, and press **Connect**. It follows the device live: turn a knob on the FM-1 and the editor moves.

- **Sound** — every parameter of the selected track, the engines and the presets.
- **Sequencer** — the steps; on the drum track a grid of 16 sounds × the steps, with levels and ratchets, and the kit.
- **Tracks** — the four channel strips.
- **Library** — your user presets and preset files.
- **Samples** — the three user slots, files and **CHOP**.
- **Projects** — the four projects, and **Backup**: *Save a backup* writes everything on the FM-1 to one file; *Restore from a file* puts it all back (stop playback first).
- **Settings** — global, master (DUST, DUCK, FILT, ROLL), drums.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/screens/editor-backup.png" alt="SLOOP web editor: projects and backup" width="560"></p>

The protocol is documented in [web/EDITOR_PROTOCOL.md](web/EDITOR_PROTOCOL.md).

## Compatibility

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Device | M-VAVE FM-1 (the official firmware can be put back at any time) |
| Installer and editor | **Chrome or Edge** on Windows, macOS or Linux (they use Web MIDI with SysEx) |
| Cable | a USB **data** cable, plugged directly (no hub) |
| USB audio | any computer that takes a class-compliant USB audio input (no driver) |
| MIDI IN jack | 3.5 mm TRS, through a TRS-to-DIN MIDI adapter (type A or B) |
| Not supported | Bluetooth MIDI; a USB keyboard plugged straight into the FM-1 |

## Troubleshooting

**The installer or the editor does not find the FM-1.** Use Chrome or Edge, a data cable, no hub, and allow MIDI access. Close every other app or tab that uses MIDI (a DAW, M-UPGRADE, another editor tab), then reload the page.

**An install stopped half-way.** The FM-1 waits in update mode: press INSTALL again. If SLOOP no longer starts, hold **OCT−** alone while switching on (*SLOOP USB RESCUE*) and install again.

**The black keys make no sound on a synth track.** That track plays chords or the scale on the white keys: hold **SCL** (between FX and ENV) and set **KNOB 1 CHORD** to OFF and **KNOB 3 KEYS** to OFF. The drum track always uses the black keys.

**Nothing plays from the MIDI IN jack.** Try the other adapter type (A / B); check the keyboard's channel (1–3 synths, 10 drums, 4–16 the selected track).

**The USB audio input does not show.** Unplug the FM-1 and plug it back in (after an install the computer must find it again). In Audacity: Transport → Rescan Audio Devices. On Windows: Sound settings → Recording → show disabled devices.

**The USB recording is too quiet, or follows the volume knob.** Set HOME menu → **USB AUDIO** to **FULL**, or turn MASTER up.

**Recorded notes move to the grid.** SLOOP quantises what you record to the steps of the track (its **DIV**: 1/4 … 1/32, triplets). For finer timing, set DIV to 1/32; for groove, use SWING.

**Notes fade out on a dense part.** The processor is at its limit: SLOOP fades one voice at a time (never the bass or the lead) rather than glitching. Fewer held notes or a lighter engine help.

**The lights or SYNC went back to OFF / INT.** You went back to an earlier SLOOP, which does not keep them; set them again in 2.3.

## Building and tests

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md). In short: the JieLi toolchain and three files of the AC79 SDK, then `./build.sh` (Linux / macOS) or `INSTALL-SLOOP.bat` (Windows with WSL), which builds the firmware and serves the installer and the editor on `http://localhost:8766`.

`tests/run_tests.sh` runs the host test suite with no hardware: audio renders against golden hashes, CPU budgets, the sequencer's timing (no drift, swing, ratchets, rolls, the REC modes and the count-in, MIDI clock), the UI pages and layers, the knobs, flash storage, the update loader, MIDI and USB audio, and the web pages (editor, backup, CHOP, installer).
